  This is a small app where you can add future goals to a bucket list and remvove
  them when you have completed them. I used Angular 5, JavaScript, TypeScript, SASS 
  and HTML in this project. <a href="" (click)="sendMeHome()"><strong>Take me back</strong></a>.

<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let goal of goals">
    {{goal}}
  </li>
</ul>
